### Explain for me SQL in simplest way
* **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It provides a way to communicate with databases and perform operations such as retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data. (SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.)

Here's a simplified explanation of SQL using common terms:

1. Tables: Think of a table as a spreadsheet. It has rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row represents a specific data entry, and each column represents a particular attribute or piece of information.

2. Queries: In SQL, you use queries to interact with the database. A query is like a question you ask the database to get the information you need. For example, you can ask the database to give you all the records from a specific table or filter the records based on certain conditions.

3. Select Statement: The SELECT statement is commonly used to retrieve data from a table. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and any conditions to filter the data. For example, you can use SELECT to fetch the names of all customers from a customer table.

4. Insert Statement: The INSERT statement is used to add new data into a table. You provide the values you want to insert for each column, and the statement creates a new row with that data.

5. Update Statement: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. You specify the columns and values you want to update, along with any conditions to identify which rows to update. For example, you can use UPDATE to change the email address of a specific customer.

6. Delete Statement: The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table. It allows you to specify the conditions to identify the rows you want to delete. For instance, you can use DELETE to remove all orders that are older than a certain date.

These are just a few basic concepts of SQL. SQL is a powerful language that offers more advanced features like joining tables, aggregating data, creating and modifying database structures, and much more. However, understanding these fundamental concepts will give you a good starting point for working with SQL and relational databases.

## Developer Notes

### API (Application Programming Interface)
* An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another.
#### How do APIs work?
* The working principle of an API is commonly expressed through the request-response communication between a client and a server. The client is any front-end application that a user interacts with. The server is in charge of backend logic and database operations. In this scenario, an API works as a middle layer between the client and the server, making it possible to send data requests and responses.

### NumPy
* NumPy is a general purpose array processing package. It provides a high performance multidimentional array object and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python.

### Pandas
#### What is Pandas?
* Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
* It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
* The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by **Wes McKinney** in 2008.
#### Why Use Pandas?
* Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
* Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
* Relevant data is very important in data science.
#### What Can Pandas Do?
1. Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:
* Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
* What is average value?
* Max value?
* Min value?
2. Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.
  
### OOPs-Concepts
* Major OOP (object-oriented programming) concepts in Python include Class, Object, Method, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction, and Encapsulation.
